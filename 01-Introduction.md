# Introduction

Typescript is a superset of JS.

TypeScript = JavaScript + Type system

## Static Checking

TypeScript detects errors in our code **without running it**. This is called static checking. JS executes the code.

TypeScript does this error checking on the basis of the "kinds of data" in our program AKA types!

## Why Types ?

TypeScript's Type System

- Helps us find errors!
- Analyzes our code as we type
- Only exists in development
